We need the user to be able to have longer sessions in the app without the requirement of refreshing for ne token generation or
logging in repeatedly to regenerate the token to get authenticated to use the application

How It All Works Together

Initial Login:

User logs in and receives both access token (short-lived) and refresh token (long-lived)
Access token is used for API calls
Refresh token is stored securely for future token refresh


During Normal Usage:

Access token is automatically attached to all API requests
User interacts with the application normally


When Access Token Expires:

API returns 401 Unauthorized
Client intercepts this response
Client uses refresh token to get a new access token
Original request is retried with new access token
User experiences no interruption


Long-Term Session Management:

Refresh tokens last much longer (30 days in our implementation)
User maintains session across app restarts and browser sessions
Session only expires after 30 days of complete inactivity


Additional Security:

Sessions time out after extended inactivity (with SessionTimeoutHandler)
Refresh tokens are stored in database and can be revoked
Each login generates a new refresh token, invalidating old ones



This implementation provides a seamless user experience while maintaining security:

Users don't have to log in frequently
Sessions persist across browser restarts
API calls are automatically authenticated
Token refresh happens in the background
